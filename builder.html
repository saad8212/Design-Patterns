    <h2 style="width:80%">The Builder pattern is used to create objects in "steps". Normally we will have 
        functions or methods that add certain properties or methods to our object.
        The cool thing about this pattern is that we separate the creation of properties and methods 
        into different entities.
        If we had a class or a factory function, the object we instantiate will always have all the properties 
        and methods declared in that class/factory. But using the builder pattern, we can create an object and
         apply to  it only the "steps" we need, which is a more flexible approach.
         It 's component based pattern in which we make final object by dividing it into different steps/components
         in below example, we have made an component for name and age,,, other for height and at the end we have 
         build this one.'

    }

    const BuilderFunc = function(name, age) {
        this.name = name,
        this.age = age,
        this.setHeight = function (height) { //These are sub parts and we make the whole object by different steps
            this.height = height;
            return this;
        }
        this.build = function() {
            return new Person (this.age, this.height, this.name);

    const emp1 = new BuilderFunc("Ali", 34).setHeight(5.6).build();
